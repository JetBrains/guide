Communication between a Blazor client app and an API is done via HTTP using [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html). 

## API/server-side communication
For the purposes of HTTP Communication in Blazor apps, APIs accept and return JSON (mostly, though it's possible to use XML or a custom format). A nice feature of .NET and Blazor is that they contain classes that help us send and receive data between clients and APIs. 
Use the resources from `System.Text.Json` or go with a 3rd party libraries such as [Json.Net](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json) to work with JSON, so you don't have to parse it yourself. 

Blazor apps use `System.Net.Http.HttpClient` to send and receive requests and responses from APIs. However, itâ€™s necessary to first register `HttpClient` with the runtime. We do that by appending the service to the `WebHostBuilder` using a call to `AddHttpClient`. This lets the runtime know which classes call to which endpoints. 
You may register HTTP clients and services in `Program.cs` to access any HTTP API. 

`builder.Services.AddHttpClient();`

If you're accessing an API through a service layer that uses `HttpClient` in your Blazor app, you can specifically register the service:

`builder.Services.AddSingleton<ToDoService>();`


```cs 
@code {
     private List<ToDo>? ToDos = new List<ToDo>();
    private bool error;
    private bool shouldRender;
    private HttpClient Http;
    
    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        var request = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Get, "https://localhost:7275/api/ToDos");
        request.Headers.Add("Accept", "application/json");
        request.Headers.Add("User-Agent", "ToDoList");
        
        var client = ClientFactory.CreateClient();
        var response = await client.SendAsync(request);

        if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
        {
            await using var responseStream = await response.Content.ReadAsStreamAsync();            
            ToDos = await response.Content.ReadFromJsonAsync<List<ToDo>>();                       
        }
        else
        {
            error = true;
        }
        shouldRender = true;
    }
``` 


> **Tip**
> Rider is an excellent tool for working with APIs and JSON data. Open the Endpoints Tool Window through the **View | Tool Windows | Endpoints** menu option. From there you can navigate to the code behind the endpoint and make, manage, and save calls to endpoints. The **Endpoints Tool Window** gives a great look at the various endpoints in your solution.

## Conclusion
Accessing an API from a client app is a popular and mature approach to app building. ASP.NET has supported this method of development by providing a framework and runtime with a middleware layer so that each project can be built to spec. Blazor enables ASP.NET developers to create the client side without as much JavaScript as there otherwise might be.
