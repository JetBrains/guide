This tutorial will take you through installing and setting up PyCharm, customising the user interface, configuring your Python interpreters, managing your Python packages, getting assistance writing your code, and then running, refactoring and debugging your code.

## Sample code
This is the code that we will be using in this tutorial:
```python
class Car:

    def __init__(self, speed=0):
        self.speed = speed
        self.odometer = 0
        self.time = 0

    def say_state(self):
        print("I'm going {} kph!".format(self.speed))

    def accelerate(self):
        self.speed += 5

    def brake(self):
        if self.speed < 5:
            self.speed = 0
        else:
            self.speed -= 5

    def step(self):
        self.odometer += self.speed
        self.time += 1

    def average_speed(self):
        if self.time != 0:
            if self.time != 0:
                return self.odometer / self.time
            else:
                pass

```
