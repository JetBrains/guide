Game development has entered a new era with the rise of AI-powered tools. But where is AI truly helpful, and where should we tread carefully? Join JetBrains Developer Advocates as they explore the role of AI in game development and showcase the capabilities of JetBrains AI Assistant.

In this session, we will:

- Share insights from a survey of game developers on their views and experiences with AI tools, including where they see the most potential and the biggest challenges.
- Discuss the strengths and limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the context of game development tasks. Learn where AI can help, and where traditional tools and methods are preferable.
- Demonstrate how to use AI Assistant in JetBrains Rider to boost your productivity when working with Unity, Unreal Engine, and Godot.

This livestream is for game developers of all levels who are curious about AI and its potential impact on the industry. Come learn how to create better games, faster – with or without AI.
