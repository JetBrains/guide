Now the waiting starts. On an active project, hopefully your PR will be reviewed soon.
Your PR might get comments from reviewers that you need to fix. For complex changes, this might take several iterations. For smaller changes, hopefully it won’t.
Before doing a lot of work on an issue you might want to check that your contribution is wanted and your solution is what they are looking for. Don't be discouraged by review comments. Keep in mind that the maintainers will have to maintain your solution in the future and they want to make sure that it fits their project.

As you can see, reviewers can comment on your PR, approve the PR or request changes which must be addressed before merging. A project might have other checks set up that need to pass before merging. You might want to check that these checks pass and that there are no conflicts with the main branch.
