When expressions have always been powerful, but in Kotlin 2.1 it is becoming even more powerful with guards.

To enable it:

- Ensure you are using Kotlin 2.1.0 or later in your project
- Add `-Xwhen-guards` as a compiler argument

For IDE support, use the latest 2024.3 version of IntelliJ IDEA with K2 mode enabled.
