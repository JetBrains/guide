In this episode, you'll learn how to navigate and fix errors using intuitive keyboard shortcuts, scan your entire project for issues, and fine-tune inspection rules to match your coding standards.

PhpStorm’s deep knowledge of PHP allows it to detect and fix a wide range of errors for you.

From deprecation notices to syntax errors, from incompatible types to wrongly ordered arguments – PhpStorm will tell you all about them.

PhpStorm will show you how many errors and warnings a file contains, and you can navigate between them by pressing <kbd>F2</kbd>. And remember, you can use the <kbd>Shift+Shift</kbd> menu to find the right shortcut if you don’t know it.

Besides telling you about errors, PhpStorm can fix many of them for you, too. All you have to do is press <kbd>Alt+Enter</kbd> – that’s that second keyboard shortcut I told you about before.

If that wasn’t enough, PhpStorm can also scan your whole project, or parts of it, all at once. Select a folder, press <kbd>Shift+Shift</kbd>, and search for Inspect; choose which folders to scan, press Analyze, and there you have it, a list of all errors within your code. You can scroll through them, and you can even press <kbd>Alt+Enter</kbd> within the preview window to fix the discovered errors. There’s no need to open any files.

Finally, PhpStorm has a huge amount of inspections – these are the rules that detect errors and warnings.

You can fine-tune all inspections by going to Settings | Editor | Inspections. You can change each inspection’s severity level and enable or disable specific rules. You can do all of this via the context menu: go to an error or warning that you want to change, press <kbd>Alt+Enter</kbd>, and then open the Options menu by pressing the three dots to the right of a suggested quick-fix. You’ll get a dedicated menu to finetune or disable this specific inspection.
