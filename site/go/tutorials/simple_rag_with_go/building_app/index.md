## Knowledge Base

We will be using AWS Bedrock [Knowledge Bases](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/knowledge-bases/) to provide additional information to the LLM, so they can understand the context and deliver relevant information, enabling more accurate and contextual responses for the specific needs of our application.

### What we are going to build?

We have a food menu from the restaurant which are going to feed into the knowledge base and directly interact with the LLM model to retrieve the relevant info.

So, we got a sample restaurant menu what they normally serve to their customers. This information will be feeded to the LLM, so next time we don't need to see the menu, rather talk to AI, what's special today in the menu?

Create a file `food.txt` and store this information.
