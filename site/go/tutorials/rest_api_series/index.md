The first part of this series focuses on using the standard library, a simple and native way to create HTTP servers. The second part uses the `gorilla/mux` framework, which provides a more sophisticated way of creating HTTP servers with features like middleware and routing. The third article uses the Gin framework, which provides a comprehensive solution for creating REST applications.
