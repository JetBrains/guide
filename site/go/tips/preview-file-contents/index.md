On the _Project View_ tool window, locate the gear icon, then click on it and select **Enable Preview Tab** option. After that, click on a file in the _Project View,_ and it will allow you to preview its contents without creating a new tab that you then need to close.

You can also locate the _Enable Preview Tab_ option using <kbd>⇧⇧</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Shift+Shift</kbd> (Windows/Linux), and turn it on.
