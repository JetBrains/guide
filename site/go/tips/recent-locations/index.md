The **Recent Locations** pop-up allows you to search for a specific change or recently viewed piece of code.

Invoke it using <kbd>⌘⇧E</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+E</kbd> (Windows/Linux), and the list of recently viewed files will display not only the file name but also the code snippets around the area last viewed in the file.

Invoke the same shortcut again, and only the changed files will be visible.

The best part? _Speed Typing_ works here: you can type in code to filter the results further.
