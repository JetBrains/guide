GoLand offers a builtin feature to allow you to run the tests in your project and display the coverage in a tool window as a summary for a package (folder) and file, and for each file, next to each line in the file.

Launch the test with _Coverage_ support and then use the _Coverage_ tool window to navigate to your packages/files and see their coverage.
