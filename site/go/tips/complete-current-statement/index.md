GoLand can complete statements and add required trailing commas for any composite literals (like struct, slice, etc.), and even place caret in a position where you can just start typing the next statement.

After typing parentheses, trigger the **Complete Current Statement** action, <kbd>⌃⇧⏎</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+Enter</kbd> (Windows/Linux), to add curly braces and move ethe cursor down to the beginning of the next row.
