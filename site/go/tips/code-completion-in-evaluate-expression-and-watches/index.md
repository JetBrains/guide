You got it right, the debugger also has code completion! GoLand provides a suggestion list when you evaluate the state of your application in a debugging session.

As you start typing in the _Evaluate Expression_, _Watches_ or _Conditional Breakpoints_ dialogs, code
completion will appear immediately.
