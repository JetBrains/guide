_Want to learn what a symbol is about without going to a browser?_

The IDE knows the symbol, its argument names/types/defaults, the documentation it has. Let it give you a non-interrupting window, letting you get back to work.

Invoke the **Quick Documentation** feature using <kbd>F1</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+Q</kbd> (Windows/Linux), learn more about the different symbols you're working with.
