The _Type Hierarchy_ feature allows you to answer questions such as "What interfaces a type implements?" or "What the types are that implement an interface?"

Invoke it using <kbd>‚åÉH</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+H</kbd> (Windows/Linux).

You can dig deeper through the list of hierarchy to get as much information as you need.
