**Cyclic Expand Word** helps you complete any word any from the current
open files

It's a type of code completion that analyzes your code in the visible scope, helps you to complete any word from any of the currently opened files, and provides you with suggestions from the current context, which can save you plenty of time when, for example, you are working on boilerplate code.

Press <kbd>⌥/</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Alt+/</kbd> (Windows/Linux) to search for matching words before the caret or choose **Code | Code Completion | Cyclic Expand Word**.

Press <kbd>⌥⇧\/</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Shift+Alt+\/</kbd> (Windows/Linux) for searching words after the caret or choose **Code | Code Completion | Cyclic Expand Word (Backward)**.

Hold the <kbd>⌥</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Alt</kbd> (Windows/Linux) key down and keep pressing / until you get to the word you need.
