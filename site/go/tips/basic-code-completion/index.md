_Basic completion_ provides a list of _all symbols_ available at the current caret position.

The list will include the usual mix of type, interface, and method names, keywords, and also _Live Templates_.

_Symbols from not-yet-imported packages_ are also offered, with autoimport on-the-fly when you select them.

Basic completion pops up as you start typing code, and GoLand recognizes an opportunity to complete something for you, but you can invoke it anytime by pressing <kbd>⌃␣</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+Space</kbd> (Windows/Linux).

_Basic Code Completion_ is also available for non-English symbols.
