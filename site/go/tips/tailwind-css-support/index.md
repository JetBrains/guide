Open any CSS file and start typing either `@tailwind` directives or CSS statements such as `@apply font-bold bg-blue-400;`

**Note:** You must install the [_Tailwind CSS_](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15321-tailwind-css) support plugin from the IDE Marketplace via _Settings/Preferences | Plugins | Marketplace_ for this functionality to work.
