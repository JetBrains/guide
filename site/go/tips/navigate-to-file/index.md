The _Navigate to file_ feature allows us to search for a file by name, even if we know only part of it.

You to search for a file in the current project only, your source code only, or all places. This means you can search in other places like _Go Modules_ dependencies and _GOROOT_.

**How to use:**

Press <kbd>⌘⇧O</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+N</kbd> (Windows/Linux) to invoke _Navigate to file_.

**Pro tip:**

As a hidden gem, try finding a directory by name.
