Do you want to select all the occurrences of a piece of code?

**How to use:**

Press <kbd>⌘⌃G</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+Alt+Shift+J</kbd> (Windows/Linux).

After the selection is complete, you can start editing all the fragments as if they were all the same one.

**Pro tip:**

If you plan to use this feature to rename something, then you should have a look at our [Rename refactoring](https://blog.jetbrains.com/go/2018/12/07/refactorings-in-goland-rename-refactoring/), which is designed to work safely across multiple packages, not just at the file level, with full preview and undo support.
