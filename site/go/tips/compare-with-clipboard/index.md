GoLand has a built-in diff viewer for code, revisions, and even images.

Select any pair of files and press <kbd>âŒ˜D</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+D</kbd> (Windows/Linux).

To quickly compare the editor with the clipboard, choose _View | Compare with Clipboard_.

If you have selected a single file, the IDE will prompt you to select another file to compare it to.
