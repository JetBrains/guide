Would you like to access your struct fields through getters and setters? Use the dedicated _Generate getter and setter_ action to automatically add all the necessary boilerplate code.

**How to use:**
Select a struct field, then press <kbd>⌥⏎</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Alt+Enter</kbd> (Windows/Linux) and choose _Generate getter and setter_ from the list of available actions.

Choose which fields should have these methods generated, then press _OK_ to generate them.
