Do you need to access your struct fields via getters and setters? Add all the boilerplate code you need using the dedicated _Generate getter and setter_ action.

**How to use:**
Select a struct type, then press <kbd>⌥⏎</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Alt+Enter</kbd> (Windows/Linux) and choose _Generate getter and setter_ from the list of available actions.

Choose which fields should have these methods generated, then press _OK_ to generate them.

Choose the receiver name and receiver type then continue working on your code as usual.

**Pro tip:** You can choose either all fields, or select the individual fields that need to have these methods generated.
