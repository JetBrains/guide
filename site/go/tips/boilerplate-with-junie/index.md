Want to quickly set up a new project with Junie? It's possible.

Try this prompt:

`Could you create a boilerplate Go project that includes a couple of beginner-friendly REST APIs? Please ensure the test coverage exceeds 90%, and include thorough documentation in a markdown file explaining the project architecture and the applicationâ€™s entry point.`

Note:

- Since LLM outputs can be a bit unpredictable, you, as the smart developer, should review the AI-generated code.
- **Brave** mode offers an additional level of automation, enabling Junie to execute commands without requiring confirmation. While this feature can be useful, it should be used cautiously.
