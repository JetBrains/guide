_Rename files with peace of mind._

Changed your name about what you named a file, and now you need to rename the test and example files too? Let the IDE handle all this work.

Invoke _Rename Refactoring_ via <kbd>â‡§F6</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Shift+F6</kbd> (Windows/Linux), and do the work, safely and quickly.
