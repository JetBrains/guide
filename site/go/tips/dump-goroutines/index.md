Regardless if it's for fun or investigating a bug, having a quick look at what the application is doing and its memory is always useful.

Either attach to the project using the debugger or launch a debugging session. While the application is running, click three vertical dots (More) and navigate to ðŸ“· Dump Goroutines.
