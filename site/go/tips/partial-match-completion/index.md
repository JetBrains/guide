GoLand provides completion suggestions when you type only a part of a word (any part, even characters from somewhere in the middle).

Also, case-insensitive [CamelHump](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase) completion is supported, so you can just type the capital letters along with a number of subsequent characters. For example, type _ReWrCl_ to get _io.ReadWriteCloser_.

Works automatically, you don't have to do anything.
