To create a **Java Compact File**, introduced in Java 25, right-click the `src/main/java` directory in the **Project** tool window and select **New | Java Compact File**. IntelliJ IDEA will provide a default name for the file, so your thought process is not disrupted when you want to quickly try something out. IntelliJ IDEA automatically adds an instance main method `void main()` to the file.
