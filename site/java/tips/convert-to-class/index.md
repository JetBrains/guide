Java 25 introduced the concept of implicit classes or compact source files. We can convert an implicit class to a regular class as needed. Invoke Context Actions by pressing <kbd>⌥⏎</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Alt+Enter</kbd> (Windows/Linux) and select **Convert an implicitly declared class of a compact source file into a regular class**.

The reverse is also possible, should you prefer to use an implicit class at any point. To do so, use the quick-fix **Convert into compact source file**.
