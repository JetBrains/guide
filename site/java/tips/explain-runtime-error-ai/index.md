Is your application throwing an error? Instead of searching the web for that error message, ask AI Assistant to explain it to you and suggest potential fixes!
If you have an active AI Assistant subscription, you can find the action **Explain with AI** in the console where the Exception is logged. When you select this action, AI Assistant will open a new chat with a predefined prompt, and explain the exception.
