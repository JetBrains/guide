Compact source files were introduced in Java 25. To create a compact source file, right-click the **Project** tool window (or press <kbd>âŒ˜N</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Alt+Ins</kbd> (Windows/Linux)) and select **New | Java Class**. In the **New Java Class** popup, select the option **Compact source file**.

This compact source file is created in the root directory of your project, even if you create it from another package. IntelliJ IDEA automatically adds an instance main method `void main()` to the file.
