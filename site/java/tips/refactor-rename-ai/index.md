Naming things is hard! Use AI Assistant for even better naming suggestions. Open _Refactor | Rename_ <kbd>⇧F6</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Shift+F6</kbd> (Windows/Linux) to rename a variable or method. If you are logged into [AI Assistant](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/ai-assistant.html), you'll see its naming suggestions at the bottom of the list. Select the suggestion you want, using the arrow keys and press <kbd>⏎</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Enter</kbd> (Windows/Linux) to select it. If none of the suggestions are quite what you want, you can also type the name you want yourself.
