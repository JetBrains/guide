The new `void main()` method, introduced in Java 25, does not need `String[] args`. However, should you decide to use the `args` in your code, IntelliJ IDEA will help you by also adding them to the `main` method.
Type `args` and press <kbd>‚èé</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Enter</kbd> (Windows/Linux) to select `args` from code completion.
