You can use the **New Project Wizard** to create a new project in IntelliJ IDEA. If you select the option to **Add sample code**, IntelliJ IDEA will add sample code to your project, containing a class with a main method.

If you select **IntelliJ** as your **Build system**, set **JDK** to **25**, the sample code will be a compact source file and instance main method, introduced in Java 25.
