## JetBrains AI Assistant prompts are context aware so they may differ depending on the type of project that you're working with. For example, in a Django project you might see additional prompts such as

- Suggest Django Intentions
- Suggest Django Intentions With Context

Once again, use <kbd>⌥⏎</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Alt+Enter</kbd> (Windows/Linux) and select AI Actions, then choose the option you want, such as **Suggest Django Intentions**.
