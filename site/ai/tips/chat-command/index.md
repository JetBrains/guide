Use predefined commands in the AI Assistant chat window. Type `/` to see which commands are available. If needed, use the arrow keys to select the command you want to use. Press <kbd>‚èé</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Enter</kbd> (Windows/Linux) to select the command.

For example, if you have code selected, `/explain` will explain the selected code.
