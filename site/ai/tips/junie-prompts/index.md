Do you know when to use a Junie follow-up prompt and when to use a new prompt?

A follow-up prompt is good for:

- modifying a result from the original prompt
- formulate a prompt based on the previous prompt

Start a new prompt when:

- the next task cannot benifit from the context of the previous prompt
- creating a new task that has little to do with the previous prompt
