Apply the code suggested by JetBrains **AI Assistant** in the chat to your project, by clicking one of the icons at the top right of the code snippet:

- Copy to Clipboard
- Insert at Caret
- Create File from Snippet

Or select only the code you want from the snippet and insert that in the desired location.
