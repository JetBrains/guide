Writing documentation is not everyone's idea of fun, but JetBrains AI Assistant has you covered. Use <kbd>⌥⏎</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Alt+Enter</kbd> (Windows/Linux) and select **Write Documentation**.

You can also type `/**`, press <kbd>Enter</kbd> and click **Generate with AI Assistant**, if you prefer.
