Use AI Assistant to Generate Code for you. Open the in editor prompt window either from the menu **AI Actions | Generate Code** or using the shortcut <kbd>âŒ˜\\</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+\\</kbd> (Windows/Linux) and enter your prompt.

A new tab will open with the diff. Once the code is generated, you have the option to **Accept all**, **Specify**, or **Retry**.
Use **Accept all** to accept the generated code, **Specify** to add additional specifications to your prompt, or **Retry** to try again.
