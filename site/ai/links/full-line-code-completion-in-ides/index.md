JetBrains IDEs introduce a new feature that enables developers to autocomplete entire lines of code using locally-run deep learning models. This functionality directly addresses the fundamental constraints of cloud-based alternatives, and ensures data remains on your machine without any need for external server communication. Thus, everyone can complete the code in trains, airplanes, and even ships without the internet, and extra subscriptions.

Full line code completion is available for Java, Kotlin, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, PHP, Go, and Ruby, within the corresponding JetBrains IDEs out of the box.

## Full line code completion vs. AI Assistant

There are two ways you can benefit from AI functionality in JetBrains IDEs – full line code completion and JetBrains AI Assistant. We appreciate that this might be confusing, so let’s take a closer look at what they have in common and how they differ.

Both full line code completion and JetBrains AI Assistant aim to help you work faster. They both also go beyond the standard completion that has been available in JetBrains IDEs for some time already. However, JetBrains AI Assistant is a separate product in its own right. Its feature set isn’t limited to code completion – it offers you a lot of other things, too, including context-aware smart chat and the ability to generate tests or write documentation.
