JetBrains AI Assistant, which is based on Large Language Models (LLMs). The author explains the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs, such as their ability to summarize text, generate code, and classify information, but also their limitations in terms of timeliness and non-deterministic responses.

Khalid provides strategies for getting better results from the AI Assistant, such as creating custom prompts and clarifying code suggestions. They emphasize the need to be skeptical of the AI Assistant's responses and to verify the results. Khalid concludes by highlighting the combination of artificial intelligence and human expertise in software development, and encourages readers to ask questions and provide comments.
