Developer advocates Paul Everitt, Dr. Jodie Burchell and Khalid Abuhakmeh take us through demonstrations of seven key features: refactoring and explaining code, automatic code completion, inline code generation from prompts, writing documentation, creating commit messages, and the integrated AI Chat, which acts as an LLM-based rubber duck right in the IDE.

Svetlana Zemlyanskaya, AI Assistant Team Lead, joins to explain how the AI Assistant works under the hood. She explains how this new product is able to create deeply context-aware prompts in order to get targeted answers from the underlying models. Vladislav Tankov, AI Platform Team lead, further dives into the technology behind AI Assistant, JetBrains AI service. He gives us an overview of how the AI service allows the AI Assistant to use a variety of large language models in a transparent and secure manner.

Finally, we’re joined by Max Shafirov. Max shares how the AI Assistant continues a long tradition of intelligence inside JetBrains tools, with an anecdote about how early code inspections were done in IntelliJ IDEA back in its early days.
