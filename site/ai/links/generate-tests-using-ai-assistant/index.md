In this blog post, Rachel discusses how AI can be used to generate unit tests and make the life of developers easier. She mentions that although AI can provide automation and make the development workflow smoother, it is important to carefully evaluate the results as they may sometimes be inaccurate. Rachel provides an example of a function that calculates the price of an item with tax and identifies the behaviors that should be tested.

She explains how to use the JetBrains AI Assistant in Rider to generate unit tests for the function. She also emphasizes the importance of not blindly accepting the results from AI and mentions that AI can also be used to generate tests first in a TDD approach. Rachel concludes by stating that using the AI Assistant in Rider is a great way to quickly generate meaningful tests that verify the code's functionality and meet the application's requirements.
