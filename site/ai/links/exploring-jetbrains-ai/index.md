## User Concerns and Reliability

- Addressing concerns about AI reliability and accuracy, Vladislav emphasizes using grounding techniques to ensure current and relevant information is retrieved and verified.
- The integration includes validation through IntelliJ's code analytics engines, enhancing the integrity of AI-generated code completions.

## Multiple LLM Integration

- JetBrains AI integrates various large language models (LLMs) from providers like OpenAI, Google, and Meta, selecting the best model for different tasks based on performance and requirements.
- For enterprises, the system accommodates specific needs, allowing customization based on existing contracts and infrastructure.

## Exciting Features and Future Work

- Vladislav highlights the powerful new multiline code completion and enhanced documentation systems, which now support Kotlin Multiplatform and Fleet.
- Future developments will focus on deeper integration, providing seamless functionalities such as natural language commands for code actions within the editor.
