[Jodie Burchell](https://twitter.com/t_redactyl) is the Data Science Developer Advocate at JetBrains, which makes integrated development environments or, IDEs, for many major languages. After observing the rapid growth of the AI coding assistant landscape, the company recently announced integration of an AI assistant into their IDEs.

## Understanding AI and Related Terms

- **AI**: Broadly aims to mimic human cognitive abilities.
- **Machine Learning (ML)**: Trains algorithms on data sets for specific tasks.
- **Generative AI**: Uses neural networks to create new content based on training data.
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Advanced ML models, like GPT, designed for natural language processing tasks.
- **GPT Models**: A subset of LLMs that generate text by predicting the next word in a sequence.

## Evolution of GPT Models

- **GPT-1 to GPT-3.5**: Gradual improvements in size and capabilities.
- **GPT-3**: Marked a major breakthrough with 117 times more parameters than GPT-2.
- **ChatGPT and GPT-4**: Incorporate fine-tuning and reinforcement learning for better accuracy and reduced biases.

## Factors Enabling Advancements in AI

- Development of efficient processing units (like Cuda for GPUs).
- Availability of massive data sets (e.g., Common Crawl).
- Transformer models that efficiently handle longer sequences of data.

## Impact on Software Development

- AI assistants like GitHub Copilot and JetBrains' own AI Assistant help speed up routine tasks, aid in learning, and improve productivity.
- Concerns about job displacement are countered by the argument that AI enhances but doesn't replace human problem-solving skills.

## Challenges and Ethical Considerations

- Issues like hallucination (AI generating incorrect information) and biases remain.
- In sensitive industries like healthcare and finance, privacy and security concerns are paramount.

## JetBrains AI Assistant

- Aims to integrate seamlessly into existing workflows.
- Uses the full context of the project, language, and libraries to provide relevant outputs.
- Functionality includes code generation, documentation creation, and commit message suggestions.

## Benchmarking and Feedback

- The evaluation of AI tools is currently based on user feedback and perceived quality.
- Future plans include more rigorous benchmarking against productivity metrics.
