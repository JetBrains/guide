Are LLMs going to replace developers, or just help them be more
productive? [A N M Rahman](https://bazlur.ca/2025/03/03/jetbrains-junie-my-firsthand-experience/) takes Junie out for a
spin and recounts the journey is this quick, useful article.

The lead-off jumps straight into the question with a framing that I can really get onboard with: AI-assisted code is a
big deal, but for "tasks". We won't be replaced: instead, AI will "streamline my workflow" on repetitive stuff. And who
doesn't want that? "Hey, AI -- you do the chores, I'll keep the joy."

In the first project, he used Junie to help him make an attractive website about Ramadan. Specifically, and from the
prompt: "Create a website about Ramadan to help my non-Muslim friends understand its significance." Fun project! Also in
the prompt: "The design should reflect Islamic art and culture..." I was certainly intrigued about the LLMs ability to
come up with something that reflected web design.

I don't know whether to be happy or scared that the LLM did a nice website. It was useful to see that he mentioned the
gradually building, iteratively, through Junie prompts.

The DevNexus chatbot section hit close to
home -- [making a conference demo](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/OImfRgIMC50). Specifically, a sleek chatbot UI on a
Jakarta Faces application. This project is interesting challenge:

- Stress of a conference demo
- Potentially tough audience for the result
- Unique set of technologies the demo had to work with
- Not a lot of time to work on it

Since this isn't a production app, you don't really need to understand all the choices and technologies, so it is a good
fit. He makes a nice point about generating (and updating) the README, including a screenshot (which I had never
considered.)

The closing covers "still need human oversight." I had just had a normie friend tell me AI was going to replace
developers. Thus, it was comforting to read "Donâ€™t rely on AI mindlessly." Hopefully CEOs and will keep this in mind.
The path to the demo might be fast, but the road to a forever app is long.
