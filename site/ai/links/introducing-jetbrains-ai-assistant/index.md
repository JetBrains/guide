JetBrains has released AI Assistant, a new tool that integrates generative artificial intelligence (AI) into its IDEs and coding tools. The AI Assistant is designed to automate common coding tasks and provide contextual assistance to developers. It features an AI chat interface that can answer questions and provide targeted, relevant answers by considering the current project's context.

The tool also offers AI-powered refactoring suggestions, code completion predictions, and the ability to generate documentation and commit messages. JetBrains AI Assistant is powered by the company's own AI service, as well as OpenAI's models, with plans to integrate Google LLMs in the future.
