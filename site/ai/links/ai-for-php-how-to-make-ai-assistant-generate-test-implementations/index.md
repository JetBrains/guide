This article explores how to use JetBrains AI Assistant to generate code implementations based on written tests. Instead of starting with an implementation and generating tests, this approach follows a test-driven development (TDD) approach where tests are written first.

The article demonstrates how to use AI Assistant to generate an implementation by opening the AI Actions menu, selecting "New Chat Using Selection," and providing a prompt to write an implementation for a test. AI Assistant quickly generates the implementation, which can be copied into a file and tested.

The article also explains how to save and reuse custom prompts for future use. The author acknowledges that AI Assistant may not write perfect code, but it is useful for generating boilerplate code and saving time. While AI may not replace real programmers, it is a helpful tool for accelerating the coding process.
