In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRaz78ptMPc), Baris Dere takes a thorough and thoughtful look at Junie, JetBrains’ new AI coding agent. Over three progressively complex projects — a Spring to-do app, a console-based hotel booking system, and a full-featured website — we see Junie generate, fix, and even self-correct code with minimal intervention.

The first scenario shows off Junie’s step-by-step autonomy: creating entities, wiring up a backend, adding a UI, writing tests, and recovering from both compilation and test failures. Brave mode adds an extra layer of automation, letting Junie execute commands without confirmation — useful, but something to be used with care.

In contrast to JetBrains’ AI Assistant, Junie goes beyond suggestion. It plans, executes, and even rewrites code when things go wrong. The comparison midway through the video is particularly helpful, clarifying what each tool is (and isn’t) designed for.

Baris keeps things practical throughout: highlighting where Junie’s context awareness shines, and where performance or precision still need work. Some UI issues in the third scenario don’t get resolved on the first try, reminding us that Junie is still evolving.

Overall, it’s a balanced, realistic review: Junie shows strong promise, especially in early-stage prototyping and structured workflows. As it matures, it may become a real productivity boost inside the JetBrains ecosystem.
