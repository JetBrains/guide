JetBrains AI Assistant can be used for everyday help in software development, providing coding assistance, second opinions, and summarizing information. The demo covered several topics, including chat interactions, code explanations, code refactoring suggestions, generating unit tests, generating commit messages, and voice support for future improvements. JetBrains AI Assistant can collect context from the code, analyze it, and provide relevant suggestions. It is designed to streamline routine tasks and help developers be more effective and avoid mistakes.

It can also generate code based on prompts and provide support for working with external libraries. The assistant's capabilities can be further improved, and future developments may include better handling of merge conflicts and code refactoring across multiple files.

JetBrain's AI Assistant's use of code styles and compliance with linting can be refined, and there are plans for on-premises models and integration with code editors. Developers can provide feedback and prompts to enhance the assistant's responses and customize its behavior. While it is a powerful tool, it is designed to augment developers' abilities rather than replace them.
