This post discusses how to write custom prompts for the JetBrains AI Assistant in ReSharper and Rider to make the most of AI in software development.

The post also advises challenging the AI assistant and being cautious of its answers, as it can sometimes provide incorrect or wordy responses.

Interactive prompting, where prompts build upon each other in a conversational tone, is encouraged. The post provides examples of creating basic prompts and modifying them based on the AI assistant's responses. It also mentions the ability to save custom prompts in a prompt library for repeated use. The conclusion emphasizes the importance of crafting understandable prompts and accurately judging the credibility of the AI assistant's output.
