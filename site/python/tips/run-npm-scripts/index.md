Modern web development means Node.js tools which mean a `package.json` file. This file sometimes has helper scripts under the `scripts` key. Running these perform various project operations such as `build`.

PyCharm with Pro subscription makes it easy to browse and run these. There are several different paths to opening the `npm` tool window:

- Right-click on `package.json` and choose **Show npm scripts**

- Click the `npm` tool window on left

- Invoke Recent Files with <kbd>âŒ˜E</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+E</kbd> (Windows/Linux) and type _npm_

_Note: If you leave the tool window open, resize it to take less vertical space._

Now that you can see the `npm` scripts, double-click on one to run that npm script in a run window at the bottom. Behind the scenes, this creates a temporary run configuration of type `npm`.

Sometimes your `package.json` changes and there's a new/changed/deleted `npm` script. The `npm` tool window has a `Reload scripts` button in its mini-toolbar.

One surprising addition: the names of your `npm` scripts are available as findable actions. If you have a `build` script and do Find Action, speed searching for _run build_ will let you immediately invoke it.
