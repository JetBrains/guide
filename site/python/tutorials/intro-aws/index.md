AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. It is similar when it comes to PyCharm, which helps developers to build, ship and deploy serverless functions.

This tutorial helps to understand how we can easily write serverless functions and easily deploy through PyCharm.

_Note: We'll be using PyCharm with Pro subscription for all the steps in this tutorial. We will also be using MongoDB database as our primary datastore. For that we will be relying on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)._
