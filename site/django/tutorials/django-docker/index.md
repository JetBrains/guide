In this tutorial, we will be exploring two of the most popular tools that are very helpful in your software development journey: Django, the most powerful and battle-tested web framework, and Docker, the powerful tool to orchestrate your applications. If you haven't heard about them, then it's likely you haven't been born yet.

Let's begin our journey of working together with Django and Docker.

_Note: We'll be using PyCharm Professional Edition for all the steps in this tutorial._
