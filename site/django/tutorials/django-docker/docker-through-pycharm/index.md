Let’s start running the Docker application through PyCharm.

Open the `Dockerfile` and click on the _Run_ icon → `New Run Configuration`

![step1](./images/9.png)

Under **Modify options**, click **Enable BuildKit**. According to the official [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/build/buildkit/), BuildKit serves as an upgraded backend designed to supersede the traditional builder. As the default builder in Docker Desktop and Docker Engine starting from version 23.0, BuildKit introduces new features and enhances the performance of your builds.

> **IMPORTANT**:
>
> - There is a chance that you won't see the option of **Enable BuildKit** under **Modify options** if you are using the latest version of PyCharm with Pro subscription. If you're using the latest version of Docker Desktop, it's already pre-equipped with BuildKit so there will be no change required for enabling the BuildKit separately. However, if you’re using Docker Engine versions earlier than `23.0`, you can activate BuildKit by setting the environment variable `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1`.

Next, we should set up port binding. This function enables Docker to map a port on your machine to a corresponding port inside the container.

![step5](./images/14.png)

![step6](./images/15.png)

We will bind the container port and host port to 8000.

Once you are done with the configuration, go ahead and apply the changes and click **Run**.

Starting the application may require a few seconds. The image displayed below is the _[Service tool window](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/services-tool-window.html)_.

The Services tool window helps you manage services such as run/debug configurations, database sessions, and Docker connections.

Once the application is up and running, you can easily manage it through PyCharm.

![step9](./images/18.png)

Let’s check in the browser by visiting [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

Woo Hoo! The app is running.

![step10](./images/19.png)

You can now easily view live logs inside the container.

![step11](./images/20.png)

The same goes for the `compose.yaml`.

![step12](./images/21.png)

Amazing! Well, that wasn't so tough to run Docker inside the IDE. Next up is planning for production and preparing your application.
