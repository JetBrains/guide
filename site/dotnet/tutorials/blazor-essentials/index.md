In this tutorial, we'll explore [Blazor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/?WT.mc_id=dotnet-35129-website&view=aspnetcore-7.0), a [Single Page Application (SPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) web framework that is part of [ASP.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet).

We'll start with the basics, and gradually look at working with forms, data, JavaScript interoperability, and more.
