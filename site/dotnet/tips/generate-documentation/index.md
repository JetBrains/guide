## Generate documentation

High quality software requires high quality documentation. But let's face it, writing docs just isn't a fun part of software development for most folks.
But now we have AI to create those docs for us. These XML docs generated by AI aren't just to help devs understand the code, but these XML comments are also used by tools to help explain what the code is supposed to do.

To generate XML documentation in Rider, press <kbd>Alt + Enter</kbd> on the method or class you want to document. Select **AI Actions** then **Write documentation**.
The AI Assistant examines the code and creates XML documentation in natural language that is understandable and useful.
Now there's no excuse for not having XML documentation for your code!
