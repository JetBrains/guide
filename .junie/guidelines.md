List of Incremental changes:

```
 - parse all md files in the release_notes folder and generate an html file, using the JetBrains guide design. The HTML file should include all changes listed in the release_notes folder sorted by technology not product. Also make sure to aggregate EAP versions and final releases together
```

```
 - for the release note generation also list the version number that you can find in the headline of each document, but make sure to aggregate stable release and eap
```

```
 - instead of aggregating each technology by release version have a high level aggregator for the version and then list all the changes that were released in that particular version
```
