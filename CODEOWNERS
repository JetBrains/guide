# Each line represents a rule, followed by a list of members.
# These members are the default owners for all files
#   that match the specified pattern.
# The pattern generally follows the same syntax used for
#   .gitignore files.
# The last matching rule always wins; those that appear
#   lower in the file  take precedence over rules that
#   appear higher up.
# Specify owners by their username, email,
#   or role assignment in the project.
# Examples:
# Member with username "john.smith" and member
#   with email "alex@mycompany.com" own any JavaScript file
#   in the repository
# *.js john.smith alex@mycompany.com
# Bob owns all files under "subdir" directory at the repository
#   root and all its subdirectories
#/subdir/ Bob
#
# All members who are assigned the Project Collaborator role
#   own any file under docs/ directory anywhere in the repository,
#   but not further nested files
docs/* "Project Collaborator"

# This file itself is owned by members who are assigned
#   the Project Admin role in this project.
CODEOWNERS "Project Admin"

# All members who are assigned the Project Collaborator role
#   own any file under / directory anywhere in the repository
